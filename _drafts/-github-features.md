# issues

use for yourself
![github issues example](images/issues_for_self.png)\

use as is meant, for others == bugreports



# milestones

divide up your work into manageable parts. 
versions of r packages [hadley's advice](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#release-version)

> graphs look ugly

-- put it in release version, not the needs-to-work-for-eighty-percent version

# assigning and labeling
for yourself:
filter your issues 

will-not-fix, I will do it. 
group work



# wiki
Not really necessary but could be useful, especially the linking between pages. More important to make explanation in help files really good.
I would focus most work on your help files, using the roxygen commits 

[according to github this one is realy nice](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki)
