THIS IS JUST COPY OF SLIDES

1. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
2. You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail.
3.  You are not allowed to write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.



Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead 1.
Why?
Fewer bugs 		explicit about behavior
Better code structure	breaking up complicated parts
Robust code		comfortably changing major parts
