# your most valuable collaborator, future you

You will need to work with yourself as well. 

you cannot remember everything you did or tested. so automate your tests. 

do comment as often as you find necessary, think: Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

but think about your commits as well.

``` r
## code by: Roel Hogervorst
## create useful thing #### 
## 
## creation: 230023
```

So write and explain what you do, like you would like to read it.
