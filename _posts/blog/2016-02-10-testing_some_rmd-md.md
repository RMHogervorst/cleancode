I wonder how the markdown works in here, is it the same as in rmarkdown or slightly different as in github.

### github flavor

```r
#this is github flavored markdown
a<- function(a, b = 10) {
	a*b
}

```

###rmarkdown flavour
```{r}
#this is github flavored markdown
a<- function(a, b = 10) {
	a*b
}
```

Let's see.

Also I checked different versions of tags.
