I recently found this podcast "Code Newbie". Code Newbie 's host Saron has great interviews with professional and not so professional coders. Many of her interviewies work in ruby on rails or other programming languages, but the program is not the point, it realy relates to r programming as well 

See this episode in particular <http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/the-not-so-amateur-programmer> 

Enjoy
