> What is clean code? 

I created this site to display examples and tutorials for nice R code. 

I have a series about getting [from SPSS to R]() learning to work with dplyr and ggplot2.
There are some blogposts about version control and github. 

This website is hosted on github and build with markdown documents.

Any questions or errors can be added to the issue tracker at the bottom of the page.
