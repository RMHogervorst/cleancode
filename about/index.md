## About this blog
> What is clean code? 

I created this site to display examples and tutorials for nice or better R code, also as a way to document progress in my thinking and  also just as an useful location for tips. 
 
The best learning is by teaching. 

I have a series about getting [from SPSS to R]() learning to work with dplyr and ggplot2.

There are some blogposts about [version control](https://rmhogervorst.github.io/cleancode/tags/#version%20control) and github. 

This website is hosted on github and build with markdown documents. I really want to move to blogdown but I haven't found the time. You can find small snippets of useful code and solutions on my secondary site [r-we-there-yet](https://rmhogervorst-rwethereyet.netlify.com/)

Any questions or errors can be added to the issue tracker at the bottom of the page.

Look at the excellent website [r-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com) for more posts about r.
